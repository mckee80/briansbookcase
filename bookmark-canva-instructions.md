## Step 1: Generate Your QR Code

### Option 1: QRCode Monkey (Recommended - Most Control)

1. Go to [qrcode-monkey.com](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/)

2. In the **Enter content** section:
   - Click **URL** tab
   - Enter: `https://briansbookcase.org/bookmark`

3. **Set Colors** (optional but recommended):
   - Click **Set Colors**
   - Body Color: Click and enter `#2C1810` (rich brown)
   - Background: Leave white
   - Or keep black if you prefer

4. **Customize Design** (optional):
   - You can add your logo in the center if desired
   - Or skip this for a clean QR code

5. **Quality and Size**:
   - Click **Quality and Options**
   - Select **High quality (PNG)**
   - Size: At least **1000 × 1000 pixels**
   - Error correction: **High (30%)** - handles damage better

6. Click **Download PNG**
   - Save as `bookmark-qr-code.png`

### Option 2: Canva's Built-in QR Generator (Easiest)

1. In Canva, go to **Apps** (left sidebar)
2. Search for "QR Code"
3. Select **QR Code Generator** app (or "QR Code" by Canva)
4. Enter URL: `https://briansbookcase.org/bookmark`
5. Click **Generate QR Code**
6. Customize:
   - Change color to `#2C1810` (if color option available)
   - Or keep black
7. Click to add to your canvas
8. You can resize it later (make it 1" × 1")

**Note**: Canva's QR generator automatically adds it to your design - you don't need to download separately.

### Option 3: QR.io (Professional Option)

1. Go to [qr.io](https://qr.io/)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Create new QR code
4. Enter URL: `https://briansbookcase.org/bookmark`
5. Customize:
   - Error correction: High
   - Color: `#2C1810`
   - Size: Large
6. Download high-resolution PNG
7. Bonus: QR.io provides tracking dashboard for scans

### Option 4: Simple Online Tool (No Settings Needed)

1. Go to [qr-code-generator.com](https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/)
2. Enter URL: `https://briansbookcase.org/bookmark`
3. Click **Create QR Code**
4. Right-click the QR code image
5. Select **Save image as...**
6. Save as `bookmark-qr-code.png`

**Note**: Most basic generators create QR codes with high error correction by default, so even without settings, it should work fine for printing.

### Recommended: Use QRCode Monkey

**QRCode Monkey** gives you the most control:
- Free, no account needed
- High error correction setting
- Custom colors
- High resolution download (important for printing)

## Step 5: Final Adjustments

### Check Safe Zones

1. Ensure no important text or graphics are within 0.25" of edges
2. Logo, QR code, and all text should be well within safe zone
3. Background color can extend to edges (bleed area)

### Adjust Spacing

1. Select all elements on each page
2. Use alignment tools (top toolbar):
   - **Align center** horizontally
   - **Distribute vertically** for even spacing
3. Make small adjustments to ensure balanced look

### Review Print Quality

1. Click **View** → **Zoom to 100%** (or more)
2. Check that:
   - Text is sharp and readable
   - QR code is crisp (not pixelated)
   - Logo looks clear
   - Colors look correct

### Typography Check

1. Verify all fonts are:
   - Crimson Pro, Georgia, or other readable serif font
   - Not too thin (at least Regular weight)
   - High contrast against background

## Step 6: Export for Printing

### Download Settings

1. Click **Share** (top right)
2. Click **Download**
3. Configure settings:
   - **File type**: **PDF Print**
   - **Flatten PDF**: **ON** (embeds fonts and images)
   - **Crop marks and bleed**: **ON** (shows printer where to trim)
   - **Pages**: **All pages** (both front and back)
4. Click **Download**

### Save Multiple Formats (Recommended)

Download both formats for flexibility:

1. **PDF Print** (for professional printing)
   - Use this for your print vendor
   - Includes bleed and crop marks

2. **PNG** (for test prints)
   - File type: PNG
   - Quality: Highest
   - Transparent background: OFF
   - Use this for testing at home printer

---

## Step 7: Prepare for Printing

### File Organization

Create a folder with:
- `bookmark-canva.pdf` (PDF Print export)
- `bookmark-front.png` (front side PNG)
- `bookmark-back.png` (back side PNG)
- `bookmark-qr-code.png` (original QR code)
- `bookmark-design-spec.md` (your spec document)

### Print Test at Home

1. Open the PNG files
2. Print at actual size (2" × 6")
3. Use cardstock if available
4. Check:
   - QR code scans correctly
   - Text is readable
   - Colors look good
   - Layout is balanced

## Troubleshooting

### QR Code Won't Scan

- Verify URL is correct in QR code
- Test with multiple phone cameras

### Text Too Small
- Increase font size by 4-6pt
- Use bolder font weight
- Reduce amount of text
- Increase line spacing

### Colors Look Different on Screen vs Print
- Use CMYK color mode in Canva if available
- Order a proof print before bulk order
- Accept that screens are brighter than print
- Parchment may print slightly darker

### File Too Large to Upload
- Reduce image resolution to 300 DPI
- Compress PNG files
- Use PDF format instead of PNG
- Contact print vendor for file size limits

### Canva Won't Export with Bleed
- Manually create 2.25" × 6.25" canvas (includes bleed)
- Keep important content 0.25" from edges
- Extend background to edges
- Print vendor can add crop marks

## Tips for Best Results

### Design Tips
- **Keep it simple**: Less is more for bookmarks
- **High contrast**: Ensure text is easily readable
- **Test QR code**: Always test before printing hundreds
- **Balance white space**: Don't overcrowd the design
- **Consistent fonts**: Use only 1-2 font families

### Printing Tips
- **Order a proof**: Always get 1-10 sample prints first
- **Test QR on proof**: Scan the physical printed QR code
- **Check alignment**: Ensure front and back align correctly
- **Rounded corners**: Worth the extra cost (more professional)
- **Matte finish**: Easier to scan QR codes than glossy

### Cost Savings
- **Order in bulk**: 1,000 bookmarks much cheaper per unit than 100
- **Standard sizes**: 2" × 6" is most economical
- **Simple design**: Complex designs cost more to print
- **Online vendors**: Usually cheaper than local shops

## Alternative: Using a Template

### If You Want to Start Faster

1. In Canva, search "bookmark" in templates
2. Filter by size: 2" × 6"
3. Choose a minimalist template
4. Replace their elements with:
   - Your logo
   - Your colors (#F5E6D3, #2C1810, #8B4513)
   - Your QR code
   - Your text
5. Follow export steps above

### Recommended Template Search Terms
- "minimalist bookmark"
- "literary bookmark"
- "classic bookmark"
- "simple bookmark"

## Example Text Sizes (Reference)

When your canvas is 2.25" × 6.25":

- **Logo**: 1.5" × 1.5" max (resize proportionally)
- **Tagline**: 36-42pt font size
- **QR Code**: 1" × 1" (minimum for reliable scanning)
- **Call-to-action**: 28-32pt
- **URL**: 32-36pt, bold
- **Mission statement**: 24-28pt, italic

These sizes will scale correctly when printed at actual 2" × 6" size.
